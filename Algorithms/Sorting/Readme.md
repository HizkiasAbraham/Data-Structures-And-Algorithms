## Sorting algoritms
A sorting algorithm is used to put elements of an array/list in a specific order.

##### Bubble sort
Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm that compares (iteratevely) two adjacent elements and swaps them until they are not in the intended order

###### Working of Bubble Sort
Suppose we are trying to sort elements in an accending order
1) First Iteration (Compare and sawap)
 - Starting from the first index, compare the first and the second elements.
 - If the first element is greater than the second element, they are swapped.s
