# Datastructures and Algorithms
This repo is all about lessons and examples on datastructure and algorithms that any programmer should know in order to write efficient and scalable code.

I will first state and explain basic concepts and support with example codes. I will be using `psudo code` to explain the concept and `javascript` for programming examples

## What are Datastructures?
Data structures are storages for data values in some specific way in a computer memmory. It is arranging data in computer memmory so that data values can be accessed and updated efficiently.

## What is an Algorithm?
An algorithm is a set of specific well defined steps to solve a particular problem. It takes input and generates the required output

## Why every programmer should learn datastractures and algorithms?
It helps to evaluate, choose and improve efficiency of computer programs

## Asymptotic Analysis
The efficiency of an algorithm depends on the amount of time, storage and other resources to solve a problem. This efficiency is measured by `asymptotic notation`. The study of change in performance of an algorithm with change in input size is defined as `asymptotic analysis`.

## Asymptotic Notations
Asymptotic notations are the mathematical notations used to describe the running time of an algorithm when the number of input items change.

There are mainly three types of aysmptotic notation
##### a) Big-O notation (O-notation)
Represents the upper bound of the running time of an algorithm i.e it gives the worest-case complexity of an algorithm.

##### b) Omega Notation (Ω-notation)
Represents the lower bound of the running time of an algoithm i.e it provides the best-case complexity of an algorithm.

##### c) Theta Notation (Θ-notation)
Represents the upper and lower bound bound of the running time of an algorithm, it is used for analyzing the average-case complexity of an algorithm.
